Interned at Markforged in Watertown MA from May 2022 to August 2022.
Here, I designed and set up a test suite to test the wear of various consumable components of the printer when printing with different plastic filaments.

I provided recommendations for customer-facing consumable replacements and
documentation for a testing suite that can be run on future filament offerings.
While I can't speak in detail about everything I worked on, I had a wonderful time working in this innovative field, and absolutely loved the company and the work they are doing.
