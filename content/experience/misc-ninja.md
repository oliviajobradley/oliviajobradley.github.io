Over my 4 years at Olin, I was a Teaching Advisor for 3 different classes: Design Nature (twice), Mechanical Prototyping (twice), and Principles of Integrated Engineering.

As a Teaching Assistant in these classes, I was able to help students learn about using machine shop equiptment and materials, and what were the best ways of prototyping and creating different items needed for various types of projects. Overall, I was able to learn the detail of how many machines work and what they are specialized for, added to what materials are prefered for these machines and prototypes, and help my peers learn this as well.
