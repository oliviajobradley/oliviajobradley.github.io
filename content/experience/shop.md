Starting in the summer of 2020 (the first pandemic summer and my first summer in college) I worked for my school's machine shop.

In the beginning, this role was for coming up with ways to make the machine shop accessible and available for the upcoming fall, but once the semester started (and for the following 3 years), this role evolved into becoming the go-to 3D printing person on campus. 

For the initial part of the job, I set up 3D printing stations in the Academic Center's hallways, rewriting training documents to allow for partially remote training, and creating an entirely digital work-order and mailing system, where the shop staff could make the parts students needed and mailing them back to them.

Over the next 3 years, I would update the training manuals for 3D Printing, Resin Printing, Laser Cutting and Engraving, and Powder Coating. I not only became the go-to person on campus for these machines, I also took on the role of teaching them to new students and training younger students to take my place as a Machine Shop Assistant.
