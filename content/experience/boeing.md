Between my junior and senior years of high school, I worked in the Solar Arrays Department at Boeing El Segundo.

![Badge Image][1]

I learned how solar arrays are used on satellites and assisted with solar array design and analysis (i.e. drawing generation/modification, analytical calculations, layouts, specifications, etc.).  
I created posters for Boeing clients to explain the
different types of satellites. I was able to visit the manufacturing plants for the solar cells.  
At the end of my internship, I received 2nd Place for Best Presentation in the 2018 Internship Poster Session, where interns
summarized our experience and shared what we learned.
