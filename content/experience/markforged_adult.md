I joined Markforged as a Full Time Productization Engineer on July 2023. 
<!--more-->

Productization Engineering (PE) is unique to Markforged. We are a team that operates within the Mechanical Engineering team. The concept behind PE is that we represent the voice of the customer at the 5-foot level in engineering and technical work, and everything that it touches. We are in the weeds, looking out for customersâ€™ interests, as well as other internal groups. We differ from the Product team and how they bring in customer interests, which generally operates at the 50,000 foot level, setting direction and roadmap; when it comes to customer interests, Product is strategy, while PE is tactics.

As a Productization Engineer, I focus on the FX20, creating documentation to sustain the product. 

While the team name changed, this team is the same as my internship from the previous summer.
