I was hired by Markforged as a Full Time Productization Engineer on July 2023. 
<!--more-->

Productization Engineering (PE) is unique to Markforged.We are a team that operates within the Mechanical Engineering team. The concept behind PE is that we represent the voice of the customer at the 5-foot level in engineering and technical work, and everything that it touches. We are in the weeds, looking out for customersâ€™ interests (that includes Partners!), as well as other internal groups. We differ from the Product team and how they bring in customer interests, which generally operates at the 50,000 foot level, setting direction and roadmap; when it comes to customer interests, Product is strategy, while PE is tactics.

While the team name changed, this team is the same as my internship from the previous summer.
