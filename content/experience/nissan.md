Interned at Nissan in Watertown, MA from May 2021 to August 2021.
At Nissan, I worked with the Autonomous Drive/Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (AD/ADAS) Test team.

I worked on testing and evaluating Nissan's Propilot autonomous drive system.
During this internship, I went on multiple evaluation trips around the Eastern United States. I also benchmarked Nissan's Active Safety Features against their competitors and created a proposal based on the collected information.
I helped prep multiple cars with testing and data collection systems, so they would collect performance data throughout the United States.
While I can't speak in detail about everything I worked on, I had a wonderful time working in this innovative field.
