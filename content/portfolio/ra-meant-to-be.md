For our Principles of Integrated Engineering course, I was tasked, with a team of four other students, Esme Abbot, Sushmit Dutta, Joon Kang, and Han Vakil, to design a mechatronic system that included both a nontrivial mechanical system design, fabrication, and a nontrivial electronic system involving hardware and firmware aspects with a budget of $250 in 6 weeks.

We chose to create a robot that would make a bowl of ramen for the user.
It would first deposit the correct amount of water and boil it.
N ext, it would deposit the soup flavoring powder and noodles into the bowl, cook for the allotted amount of time, and then turn off the stove when the dish was ready.
In this project, I chose to move out of my comfort zone and focus on the electrical components of this machine. One of my biggest takeaways was remembering to focus on power draw. 
For this project, we created a final project website which you can find below.
