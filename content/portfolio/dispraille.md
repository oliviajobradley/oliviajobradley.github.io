Nabih Estefan, Amit Kumar-Hermosillo, Charlotte Ramiro, and I participated in the MakeHarvard 2020 Make-a-thon. We decided to create, in our 24 hours, a portable braille scanner + display.

Dispraille is a module that uses optical character recognition (OCR) software to detect text around its user and convert it to braille using a 6-pin tactile interface. By placing a finger on the 3x2 matrix on the top of Dispraille, users can choose to read the text around them through a quick letter-by-letter run-through. For extra challenge, we chose to limit ourselves in making this project with only the materials that MakeHarvard provided, leading us to both enter in and win the top prize in the MakeHarvard Original category.
We won the MakeHarvard 2023 Original Prize, as our project was entirely created during the 24 hours of the competition using
no external materials
