Nabih Estefan, Maya Sivanandan, Florian Schwarzinger, and I participated in the MakeHarvard 2020 Make-a-thon. We decided to create, in our 24 hours, an automatic 2x2x2 Rubiks Cube solver.

![Celebration once it worked!][1]  

The difference between this and a normal Rubik's cube solver is the fact that a 2x2x2 Rubik's cube cannot be held by the center pieces to turn the sides of the cube the way Rubik's cubes are normally are held, meaning it has to be free to twist and turn while it's being solved.

We designed the structure during the start of our Make -a-thon. To solve the challenge of holding the cube, I was in charge of creating a tray and claw system. Compared to a 3x3x3 Rubiks Cube, the 2x2x2 is more difficult as it does not have a center point the robot could hold onto and twist, it needs to move freely. The tray would twist the cube in the XY plane. The claw could hold the top half, so we could twist the top and bottom halves separately.

In order to mount all of these pieces, I built a frame that was easily adjustable out of 80/20 T-slot aluminum. Our group was also pushing for the Original Prize, which meant we could only use the provided materials. These pieces were designed, manufactured, and iterated multiple times within the 24-hour competition. 

We won the MakeHarvard 2020 Original Prize, as our project was entirely created during the 24 hours of the competition using no external materials
