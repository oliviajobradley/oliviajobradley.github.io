For our Eclectronics Final Project, my partner and I wanted to create a LED Prop Module by creating a battery powered PCB with a microcontroller, LEDs, an accelerometer, and buttons, which would be enclosed in a clear capsule.

Both of us were members of the Olin Fire Arts Club, and enjoy springing and performing with fire. Spinning fire is dangerous, and fire props are delicate, so we try to avoid practicing and trying new tricks with them. The solution to this is an LED version of the prop that is more durable and less dangerous than fire props, but is still exciting and aesthetic, so it can be used to perform with if desired. This project required a board with a battery management system, bright RGBW LEDs, an accelerometer (to react to the movements of spinning), a button to change modes, and a microcontroller that can run the code to make all of these work.

We designed the board electronics from scratch, while I designed and produced the resin printed housing to hold and protect the board. Once we had both elements, we assembled the board by soldering the components we had acquired and fitting it into the created enclosure. For more detail please read the report in our github repository.

My partner for this project was Nabih Estefan.
