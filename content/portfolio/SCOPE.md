Brandeis’s Rosbash Lab does groundbreaking
research on circadian rhythms and neuroscience.
This research relies upon data collected by the
FlyBox, a box designed to house 96 fruit flies in a
stable andreplicable environment with means
for providing video footage of the flies . The
improved FlyBox provides a better working
experience for researchers at Brandeis and other
labs around the world.

This year, we overhauled the FlyBox’s hardware, assembly, and software, creating a robust and polished tool. The redesigned box structure delivers reliable experiment conditions, and custom printed circuit boards streamline wiring and simplify troubleshooting. Detailed instructions, including photos of each assembly step and engraving on frame parts, make it easy for a scientist to assemble their own FlyBox. Lastly, the brand-new software workflow for creating FlyBox tests is intuitive yet feature-rich. With the improved FlyBox, researchers from the Rosbash Lab and beyond can conduct optogenetics research with ease and consistency.
