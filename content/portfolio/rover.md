For the final Fundamentals of Robotics project, our team (Isabella Abilheira, Chris Allum, Olivia Jo Bradley, Oscar De La Garza, Nabih Estefan, Maya Sivanandan) was tasked with creating a rover that could complete several autonomous missions in The O, the center courtyard of Olinâ€™s campus.

The three main challenges were: Navigation of unobstructed terrain, Docking in a supply station, and D elivering a payload to a dropbox.

Besides this, our team decided to try and do 3 extra stretch goals: Navigate through stationary obstacles, park within the medium box of the supply station, and deliver our payload to a specific dropbox using April tags (with a possible one being finding payloads around the O and picking those up for extra deliveries).
During our demo presentation, we were able to complete the first goals, Navigation and Docking. While we were not able to complete Delivering a payload during the demo period, we did make sure we were able to complete it during our practice time.

In this project, I was the Mechanical lead. The base of our rover (the wheels, axle, and basic frame of an RC car) was provided to us. As mechanical lead, I led the design and manufacturing of a Sintra and 3D printed body that could mount and protect our electronics, and a grabber that could handle the payload. To create the grabber, I did some sketch modeling and prototyping to create a grabber that would hold closed in its rest state, in order to conserve our battery.

I did some calculations throughout the iteration process in order to hold three payloads (unfortunately, due to a rule change this was no longer necessary). Once the manufacturing was done, I assisted in testing and troubleshooting our code.

We connected to the rover using a Raspberry Pi and coded our Sense, Think, and Act functions that allowed our rover to operate autonomously in Matlab. For file management, we used Matlab drive for our software files and Grabcad for our CAD files.

After our project, this rover was shipped to India for studies by MATLAB engineers in order to improve MATLAB's robot control and Raspberry Pi interface!
