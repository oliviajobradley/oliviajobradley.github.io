For our Software Design Final Project, Maya Sivanandan, Chris Allum, and I wanted to create a game similar to one of our favorite childhood flash games, Fireboy and Watergirl.
<!--more-->
Below is a short description of our game:
Welcome to MagmaBoy and HydroGirl, a two-player platforming game inspired by Fireboy and Watergirl! Grab a friend and together play as MagmaBoy and HydroGirl, two friends exploring an abandoned temple.
But be careful! MagmaBoy can’t touch the water puddles, HydroGirl can’t touch the lava pools, and neither of them can touch the green goo pools or the level will end! Use the buttons, platforms, and collaboration to get to the final doors and into the next room.
For this project, we mainly used Pygame and Github for file management.
