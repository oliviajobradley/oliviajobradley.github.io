Hello!
I'm Olivia Jo, a Robotics Engineer from Olin College of Engineering. You can usually find me messing with 3D printers, playing water polo, working on embroidery projects, or spinning fire (more on that below). 
Please look at some of my work experience and projects in the tabs to the left!
Here's a little bit more about me, outside of school and engineering.
I am from Rancho Palos Verdes, a suburb Los Angeles, near the beach.
I've been a swimmer since middle school, did junior lifeguards growing up, and have played water polo since high school. I played on Wellesley's club team.
One fun hobby I started in college is fire spinning and flow arts! I dance and perform to music while spinning various props that have little balls of fire on the ends!
During quarantine, I picked up embroidery! I'm currently trying to learn different kinds of stitches and really enjoy making gifts for friends.
![This is me][1]
